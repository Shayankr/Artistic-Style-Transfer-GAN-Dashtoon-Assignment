# Artistic-Style-Transfer-GAN-Dashtoon-Assignment
Implement VGG19 based CNN to design Artistic-Style-Transfer Neural Net using the concept of Generative Adversial Neural Network.



This repository contains the code and resources for the Artistic Style Transfer GAN project, created as a part of the Dashtoon Assignment.

## Description
Artistic Style Transfer involves taking two images: a content image and a style image. The neural network learns to apply the artistic features of the style image to the content image, resulting in a visually appealing and unique composition. This technique has applications in generating captivating artwork, transforming photographs, and exploring the intersection of artificial intelligence and artistic expression.
